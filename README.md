# SQL-Injection-Labs
My lab notes and learning progress for the Web Security Academy's SQL Injection chapter.

Follows PortSwigger's Web Security Academy training path. This repository is a record of my labs for Chapter 1: SQL injection. The course can be found here: https://portswigger.net/web-security/learning-path

The labs are done on Kali Linux VM on VirtualBox, where I also utilize Burp Suite Community Edition 2023.7.2.

### General notes


### Automation
Manual SQL injections (or manual pen testing in general) via random payloads will only catch the low hanging fruits. Moreover, bots can already do this. As such, I will not only try to solve these labs manually, but also I will attempt to write a Python script that performs the SQL injection(s).

When I do come across a vulnerability that requires scripting/automation in the future, such as a blind SQL injection vulnerability, I will have been more familiar with it.
